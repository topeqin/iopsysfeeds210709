# Part of luci-app-voice.
# This file adds dependencies to /etc/config/ucitrack to allow uci to
# 1. recreate asterisk configuration files
# 2. restart asterisk
# whenever a user applies settings in the luci UI
#
# This file should be placed in /etc/uci-defaults/ on installation of
# the luci-app-voice-client. It will then be executed (once) by uci
# on the following reboot.
