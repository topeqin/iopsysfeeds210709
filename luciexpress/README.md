LuCi Express
------------

This is an effort to simplify luci web gui for OpenWRT using modern frameworks and coding standards like angular.js. 

LuCi express is a client-side JavaScript/HTML5 application that communicates with your OpenWRT router over ubus calls (JSONRPC2.0). 

To run the gui, simply place htdocs directory into the web root of your router and navigate to the htdocs/index.html page.
