Install scp server.

Create a user account on a server and make sure it's possible to login to it
using ssh.

For now the user has to be called "log"

USER is the user name of the account
HOME is the user home directory.
Both should be changed to the correct value in all following example commands.

create HOME/bin
Put scp_upload in HOME/bin
make it executable "chmod a+x HOME/bin/scp_upload" 

create home/.ssh   (observer the dot .shh)

create an empty file HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys

-------------------------------
Now everyhting is setup for use but we have not added any clients.
What we need is the public key for the clients.

For dropbear "dropbearkey -y -f files/etc/dropbear/logid" will generate the public key.

----------
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCwn9RaDAzxW1dTmIhXgFBnpi1lhj8xhYpCVQiPxxdk9IEmH8zjo4y9j3sPkqKOlRnkwjpZIpLEKBnpQTwVIMCU/AG7nDJX3OH9RfS9mLJQLfFL8HyGCyqDezFWldbyovhJZvdUeK4tAXJWv2W3OVHiz2L8IlncBgP/E9DJElsyhhQHsM96UE6tBkXsvXkoDbMSYXFcLbgiUwBKfmM2BF/aPDL45iznGur7/2j9v95PwJ0gtMu9jjNRq+pXCXhTh3bsnczm0MpZC1aiRc9nJAeGIMmhrf15E4jBKgTnrstzJxGVAdajKeR954KcNsS33cS2Wmui2YjmPbBXjqf1frzJ log@inteno
----------

The public key should be just one line. Add that line to the 
HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the scp server. Then add the follwoing as
the first text on the same line. that is insert before the key data.

command="HOME/bin/scp_upload",no-port-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding 

Do not forget to change HOME to the correct value for the server and there 
should be one space separating the key data and the above text.
---------------------------------
Now test to make sure that you can upload new files, not download files
and not overwrite files from the client.
